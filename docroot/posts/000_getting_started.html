				<h1>Building web apps from scratch - Getting Started - Part 0</h1>
<p>
In the past few years, I had some fun studying how web apps are built from the ground up. It's been a great journey, so I decided to share what I learned by making a series of posts showing how one can build a web app from scratch. We will build a simple social network featuring posting articles and following other users. If you follow along, by the end you'll have a fully functional website ready for real users!

<br/>
<br/>

This is the first time undertaking such an ambitious project, so I welcome any feedback :)

<br/>
<br/>

We'll be using the C programming language for everything, since it's low level enough to do things efficiently and not very opinionated. The libraries we will be using:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bearssl.org/">BearSSL</a> for encryption</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> as database</li>
</ul>
<p>but we can worry about that later.

</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
To follow along, you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A good grasp of C programming</li>
<li>An idea of how HTTP works: what is a request, a response, and their general syntax.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<p>
Our setup won't be very fancy. We will use a regular code editor to write our code and a terminal to build it. All of the code will work on both Linux and Windows.

<br/>
<br/>

On Linux, you must install:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code> for building our application</li>
<li><code>gdb</code>, <code>valgrind</code>, and <code>strace</code> for debugging</li>
</ul>
<p>
On Windows, you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use WSL to simulate a Linux environment</li>
<li>Go native</li>
</ol>
<p>WSL is harder to set up, but you will have access to the tools I listed above. Any considerations made for Linux will also apply to you.

<br/>
<br/>

If you still want to go native, then you should download <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit">w64devkit</a>, which is is an unix-like environment for Windows built by the awesome author of <a href="https://nullprogram.com/">nullprogram.com</a>. It contains <code>gcc</code>, <code>gdb</code>, <code>make</code> and some other utilities.

</p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>
We will start by building a <strong>blocking web server</strong> with the <strong>socket interface</strong> provided by the operating system. We will then add a <strong>database</strong> and implement the first version of our application. You could host this version online, but only as a test, since there will be <strong>no encryption</strong>. Then, we will reorganize our server to make it <strong>non-blocking</strong>, greatly increasing how many requests the server can handle at a given time. Finally, we will add encryption.

<br/>
<br/>

But before all of that, I decided to offer an overview of how networks work. This will give you a sense of what the OS is doing for us. So in the <a href="001_the_network_stack.html">next post</a> we will go over the general structure of the internet and the protocols it uses.</p>
