				<h1>Building web apps from scratch - Getting Started - Part 0</h1>
<p>
I've always been fascinated by how web applications work. After spending the past few years diving how they are build, I thought it would be fun to share what I've learned! In this series of posts, we'll build a social network-like website from scratch. Think of it as a journey where we'll explore how all the pieces fit together. By the end, you'll have a fully functional website ready for real users!

This is the first time undertaking such an ambitious project, so I welcome any feedback :)

We'll be using the C programming language for everything, since it's low level enough to do things efficiently and not very opinionated. The libraries we will use are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bearssl.org/">BearSSL</a> for encryption</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> as database</li>
</ul>
<p>but we can worry about that later.

</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
To follow along, you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A good grasp of C programming: there is a lot to cover and I won't be able to delve into the details of everything, not at first at least. I plan on accompanying the main posts with secondary posts explaining the things I had to gloss over.</li>
<li>You should have an idea of how HTTP works: what is a request, a response, and their general syntex.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<p>
Our setup won't be very fancy. We will use a regular code editor to write our code and a terminal to build it. All of the code will work on both Linux and Windows.

On Linux, you must install:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code> for building our application</li>
<li><code>gdb</code>, <code>valgrind</code>, and <code>strace</code> for debugging</li>
</ul>
<p>
On Windows, you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use WSL to simulate a Linux environment</li>
<li>Go native</li>
</ol>
<p>WSL is harder to set up, but you will have access to the tools I listed above. Any considerations made for Linux will also apply to you.

If you still want to go native, then you should download <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit">w64devkit</a>, which is is an unix-like environment for Windows built by the awesome author of <a href="https://nullprogram.com/">nullprogram.com</a>. It contains <code>gcc</code>, <code>gdb</code>, <code>make</code> and some other utilities.

</p>
<h2>The Roadmap</h2>
<p>
The project will be divided 3 parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1</strong>: we will create a simplified yet complete version of our application. This will include a <strong>blocking web server</strong>, the <strong>database</strong>, and <strong>no encryption</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2</strong>: we will improve our web server by making it <strong>non-blocking</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3</strong>: we will add <strong>encryption</strong>.</li>
</ul>
